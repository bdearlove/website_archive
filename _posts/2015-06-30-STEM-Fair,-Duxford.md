Trialling one of my new outreach activities today - Build Your Own Bacteria - for [STEM Team East](https://twitter.com/STEMteameast)'s annual STEM Fair Young Investigators' Day. First we'll discuss what features (glowing in the dark? antibiotic resistance? being able to communicate?) would make a good microbe, and then students will get to create their own 3D bacteria models. Tomorrow I'll be doing yeast cultures for the older students. It's meant to be a hot one, so hopefully the jelly medium will still set!

This also has to be the coolest place I've ever held a workshop - in the shadow of the historical planes in the AirSpace hanger of the [Imperial War Museum, Duxford](http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-duxford/).
