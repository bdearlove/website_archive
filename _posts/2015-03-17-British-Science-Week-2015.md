I spent this morning with Year 4 at St. Alban's Catholic School, Cambridge as part of their activities for [British Science Week](https://www.britishscienceweek.org/). We spoke about what can make us ill, with my growing collection of Giant Microbes as popular as ever. They were a chatty and interactive bunch, and I was completely blown away when amongst the usual answers of 'bugs' and 'germs' I also got 'tuberculosis' and 'AIDS'. We then plated out some yeast in Petri dishes for them to observe growing over the next week or so. This uses my own 'kitchen safe' recipe as a growth medium, which reassures parents some!
